# MedTracker

MedTracker is a simple medication tracking application that helps users monitor their medicine schedules and inventory. It alerts users when it's time to take their meds and keeps track of remaining stock.

## Features

- Add and manage medication entries
- Schedule reminders/alarms for medications
- Track remaining inventory
- Minimal, functional interface for basic tracking needs

## Motivation

This project was developed during my free time as a way to explore programming concepts and build something useful. It was created with the help of **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot**.

I initially attempted to port this project to Android, but due to technical limitations and compatibility issues, I decided to focus on a desktop-first or general-purpose implementation instead.

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- SQLite
- Git for version control
- Kivy for simple GUI.

## Status

ðŸš§ This app is currently under development.
