# Learning the fundamentals of major languages! 

This repository contains all the code I've written as part of my journey to learn **major languages** (i.e. **Python**, **C++**, **HTML + CSS**). Everything here reflects what I've done to explore, experiment, and understand both languages more deeply.

## Motivation

The main goal of this repository is **learning by doing**. I wanted to build a space where I could try out concepts, make mistakes, and improve over time.

## Tools & Resources

Throughout this journey, I’ve used the following tools and platforms to help me learn:

- 📺 **YouTube** – for tutorials, walkthroughs, and hands-on guides.
- 🧠 **ChatGPT** – for explanations, code reviews, and problem-solving help.
- 💻 **Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with GitHub Copilot** – for writing, testing, and exploring code with AI-assisted suggestions.
- 🖥️ **[WS3 Schools!](https://www.w3schools.com/)** - A BIG help! Contains an online compiler so I didn't have to boot back and forth within Fedora and Windows.

## What's Inside

- 🐍 Python scripts and projects covering basic to intermediate topics.
- 💠 C++ code samples, exercises, and mini-projects.
- 🖥️ And now HTML + CSS! I want to learn basic formatting, then move to JS.
- Notes, test files, and any other experimental code I've worked on.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal learning space. Some code may be messy, unfinished, or purely experimental. You're welcome to explore, but keep in mind this is **not** production-level code—it's a coding playground.

## License

Feel free to learn from or build on anything here. If you find something useful, that’s great! 😊
